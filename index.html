      <h3>AVENTADOR</h3>
      <p>For those considering the standard Aventador unsatisfying, Lamborghini pulled the wraps off the Super Veloce (SV) version at the 2015 Geneva Motor Show. Continuing with the Super Veloce tradition, the Aventador LP750-4 SV's engineers took care of almost every bit and piece in order to shave off the excess and make the supercar even lighter.</p>

      <h3>VENENO</h3>
      <p>If you've ever wondered how you can make €10 million with three brand new objects of metal and carbon, this is it. It's called the Veneno, and it's the perfect way for Lamborghini to overshadow McLaren and Ferrari on their big day in Geneva.</p>

      <p>This seems to be the way for Lamborghini’s Huracan, or LP610-4 as pedants call it.
Carbon fiber has found its way next to the aluminum in the chassis, which means that the supercar now has a dry weight of 1,422 kg (3,135 lbs). The Italians also talk about a stifness increase, but actual figures are replaced with metaphors.</p>

      <p>The Italian supercar manufacturer introduced in 2008 the new Reventon model. Like the other Lambo models, this exotic sports car takes its name from a Spanish fighting bull, this one is famous for killing renown bullfighter Félix Guzmán in 1943. </p>

Production lasted until 1979 and during that time 791 cars were made, with 21 of them being for the American market (thus being labeled the Urraco P111).</p>

      <p>Ferruccio Elio Arturo Lamborghini (Italian pronunciation: [f?r'rutt?o lamb?r'gini]; April 28, 1916 – February 20, 1993) was an Italian industrialist. Born to grape farmers from the comune of Cento in the Emilia-Romagna region, his mechanical know-how led him to enter the business of tractor manufacturing in 1948, when he founded Lamborghini Trattori, which quickly became an important manufacturer of agricultural equipment in the midst of Italy's post-WWII economic boom. In 1959, he opened an oil heater factory, Lamborghini Bruciatori, which later entered the business of producing air conditioning equipment. In 1963, he most famously created Automobili Lamborghini, a maker of high-end sports cars in Sant'Agata Bolognese. Lamborghini founded a fourth company, Lamborghini Oleodinamica in 1969. Lamborghini sold off many of his interests by the late 1970s and retired to an estate in Umbria, where he pursued winemaking.
 All of Ferruccio Lamborghini's companies continue to operate today in one form or another. His son, Tonino, designs a collection of clothing and accessories under the Tonino Lamborghini brand, as well as designing the Town Life, an electric microcar which was revealed at the Bologna Motor Show in 1999.[32][33] Ferruccio's daughter, Patrizia Lamborghini, runs the Lamborghini winery on his Umbria estate. In 1995 Ferruccio's son Tonino opened a museum that honors Lamborghini's legacy, the Centro Studi e Ricerche Ferruccio Lamborghiniin Dosso (Ferrara), which was moved to Argelato (Bologna) in 2014 with the new name FERRUCIO LAMBORGHINI MUSEUM</p>

<h4><b>History Of Lamborghini</b></h4>
<p><b>Manufacturing magnate Italian Ferruccio Lamborghini founded the company in 1963 with the objective of producing a refined grand touring car to compete with offerings from established marques such as Ferrari.
 The company's first models, such as the 350 GT, were released in the mid-1960s and were noted for their refinement, power and comfort.
 Lamborghini gained wide acclaim in 1966 for the Miura sports coupé, which established rear mid-engine, rear wheel drive as the standard layout for high-performance cars of the era.</b></p>
<h6><b>Vehicle Nomenclature</b></h6>
<p>
After producing two cars with alphanumeric designations, Lamborghini once again turned to the bull breeder for inspiration. Don Eduardo was filled with pride when he learned that Ferruccio had named a car for his family and their line of bulls; the fourth Miura to be produced was unveiled to him at his ranch in Seville. <br>
The automaker would continue to draw upon the bullfighting connection in future years. The Islero was named for the Miura bull that killed the famed bullfighter Manolete in 1947. Espada is the Spanish word for sword, sometimes used to refer to the bullfighter himself. The Jarama's name carried a special double meaning; though it was intended to refer only to the historic bullfighting region in Spain, Ferruccio was concerned about confusion with the also historic Jarama motor racing track </p>
<p>Lamborghini grew rapidly during its first ten years, but sales plunged in the wake of the 1973 worldwide financial downturn and the oil crisis. Ferruccio Lamborghini sold ownership of the company to Georges-Henri Rossetti and René Leimer and retired in 1974. The company went bankrupt in 1978, and was placed in the receivership of brothers Jean-Claude and Patrick Mimran in 1980.
 The Mimrans purchased the company out of receivership by 1984 and invested heavily in the company's expansion. Under the Mimrans' management, Lamborghini's model line was expanded from the Countach to include the Jalpa sports car and the LM002 high performance off-road vehicle.
 The Mimrans sold Lamborghini to the Chrysler Corporation in 1987.
 After replacing the Countach with the Diablo and discontinuing the Jalpa and the LM002, Chrysler sold Lamborghini to Malaysian investment group Mycom Setdco and Indonesian group V'Power Corporation in 1994. 
 In 1998, Mycom Setdco and V'Power sold Lamborghini to the Volkswagen Group where it was placed under the control of the group's Audi division. New products and model lines were introduced to the brand's portfolio and brought to the market and saw an increased productivity for the brand Lamborghini. </p>

<p>This logo is connected with Lamborghini’s interest for fighting bulls.
 The interest’s history goes far in 1962 when Ferruccio Lamborghini had come to the Seville farm of famous Eduardo Miura, a Spanish who was a well-known breeder of Spanish brutal fighting bulls.</p>
